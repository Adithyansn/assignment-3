This Java program models a simple Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
It allows users to add, remove, search, and display books using a menu-driven interface.
The system is built with three classes: Book, Library, and BookManagementSystem (main program).
It uses arrays to store books and demonstrates basic OOP concepts like encapsulation and object manipulation.
